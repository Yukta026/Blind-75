1) If in a graph (u,v) has condition of u occuring before v then it's requires topological sorting which can be done by Kahn's Algorithm by counting inDegree of each node.
2) To check just validness of graph's nodes for a tree, use Disjoint union set. The union will help to check whether cycle exists.
